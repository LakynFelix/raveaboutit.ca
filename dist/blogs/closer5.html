                        <p>We still have chills thinking back to last Friday's fifth edition of <strong>CLOSER</strong>. The highly praised show hosted by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hypeakevents/"><strong>Hypeak</strong> <strong>Events</strong></a> is well-known for its next-level lineups and contagious atmosphere. Unsurprisingly, it lived up to its superior production standards once again. We can't wait to tell you what went down; let's dive right in...</p>
                        <p>Ever since festival season kicked off, there's been an undeniable electricity flowing through the air. The excitement followed us as we approached the familiar entrance of <strong>City At Night </strong>as the scheduled house music event was on our agenda. We sensed something special was about to materialize in a matter of minutes. <em>Spoiler: it did!</em></p>
                        <p>All of the touches that the organizers put into the event are truly remarkable. For instance, the CLOSER flyers are continuously eye-catching! One of the graphics was efficiently displayed above the staircase, leading party goers inside of the venue, stating "<em>tonight we get closer</em>." Two of the most sought-after local artists, <strong>Chefnier</strong> and <strong>HAMRO</strong> were also pictured.</p>

                        <p>Advertised as "<em>HAMRO'S B-Day Bash</em>" - many of this rising superstar's dedicated supporters and equally devoted followers of this event series flocked to celebrate! This fact was instantly made evident as the dance floor was practically packed right at opening. We were happy we got there early to soak in the charismatic ambience. </p>
                        <p>Performing first was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pmprecords/"><strong>PMP Records</strong></a> label boss and acclaimed artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/collins.pmp/"><strong>COLLINS</strong></a>. Known for his bass house, bassline, and tech house productions, the skilled musician certainly didn't disappoint! Throughout his set, he unleashed some hard-hitting anthems that his imprint would be proud of; not to mention, he expertly snuck in some unreleased IDs (keep it locked to his socials). </p>
                        <p>Most opening acts take a more laid-back approach to build the energy in the room. We were delighted that COLLINS didn't hold back his signature sound and passion for what he calls often "<em>underrepresented genres in Ottawa.</em>" It was instantly dynamic! It was also very sweet to see his loving girlfriend front row cheering him on alongside his army of supporters. </p>

                        <p>Now that the power of music had filled the intimate venue, the audience was eager to see what <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itsdjmikal/"><strong>MIKAL</strong></a> had in store. We knew this Canadian act had earned his spot amongst the programming thanks to his residency at the <span>ALÉA nightclub and his other impressive accomplishments under his belt. But, would he deliver a memorable experience?</span></p>
                        <p><span>Within seconds of jumping on stage, MIKAL captured everyone's attention! Not only did he command the stage thanks to his confident nature, but he also delivered a well-thought-out set. His many years of experience was quickly apparent. Between his track selections and adept transitions, he kept us all dancing from start to finish! We're counting down until we can see him again.</span></p>

                        <p><span>Speaking of dancing, the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ottawashufflers/"><strong>Ottawa Shufflers Community</strong></a> brought out <em>all</em> of the moves! Take it from someone who's been following their journey since the beginning - their footwork has continued to improve, and it's a joy to watch them come alive on the dance floor. They also must have been extra hyped because their debut event <strong><em>Neon Nights</em></strong> was exactly one week away. <a href="https://theflaggang.com/blogs/news/bytown-blog-ottawa-shufflers-community-neon-nights">Grab your tickets</a>!</span></p>

                        <p><span>At this point of the night, everyone was mingling, and no one was without a smile on their face! The event's photographers, <strong>Brandon</strong> <strong>Hebert</strong> AKA <a href="https://www.instagram.com/613digitalclicks/"><strong>@613digitalclicks</strong></a>, <strong>Sam</strong> <strong>Daly</strong> AKA <a href="https://www.instagram.com/samuel__daly/"><strong>@samuel_daly</strong></a>, and <strong>Anthony Doniewski</strong> AKA <a href="https://www.instagram.com/antonyphoto/">@anthonyphoto</a> smoothly swooped in to capture all of the best moments of the evening's festivities. Huge shout-out to them for their hard work and indisputable talent!</span></p>
                        <p><span>As the cameras lights were flashing almost as big as the participants' smiles, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/djhamro/"><strong>HAMRO</strong></a> took the decks. We wouldn't have doubted it if the other provinces heard the crowd's eruption in excitement of his arrival! If you caught our <a href="https://theflaggang.com/blogs/news/exclusive-interview-hamro?_pos=1&amp;_sid=fb9e3c97b&amp;_ss=r"><strong>exclusive</strong> <strong>interview</strong></a> with this local legend, you know his star is shining bright, and he is loved by many. Last Friday was no exception!</span></p>
                        <p><span>The riddim and dubstep-loving artist sported an epic birthday-themed hat. As one of his sole house music sets progressed, fitting enough, the "chapeau vacances" energy truly <em>took the cake</em>. At midnight, the entire club sang '<strong>Happy Birthday</strong>' to HAMRO, while he grinned in appreciation. There's such a unique star quality about him - it's captivating to witness.</span></p>
                        <p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0053/4862/2449/files/HAMRO-07_480x480.png?v=1654605806" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="374" height="249" /></span></p>
                        <p><span>Although we could attempt to describe the energy during his set, Hebert truly captured the moments perfectly. Be sure to check out the photos below as they give you an exclusive glimpse into the magic that unfolded that night. Time and time again, we are blown away by what CLOSER always delivers - uniting music enthusiasts in the best way possible!</span></p>

                        <p><span>While the vibes were high, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chefnier/"><strong>Chefnier</strong></a> took the decks. This performance would mark his first-ever entirely house set. The up-and-coming producer is established in the music industry due to his melodic/experimental and generally lyric-heavy singles. Hearing him play house dominant tracks was quite refreshing! We can't wait to see what he has in store for his b2b set at <strong>Escapade Music Festival</strong>.</span></p>

                        <p><span>We'd like to extend our sincerest appreciation to the team behind Hypeak Events, the photographers, acts, staff, participants, etc. - without you all, this exclusive house experience wouldn't be the same.
