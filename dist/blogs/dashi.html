                        <p>Every once and a while, you meet someone who simply feels like sunshine. They radiate such a positive light that it makes you feel more <span>empowered to build a better world, and they lift you up just by being in their presence. When we first met <strong>Cris Vogrig</strong>, better known by his stage name <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dashibeats/"><strong>Dashi</strong></a>, we immediately knew he possessed this unique gift.</span></p>
                        <p>In addition to his beaming personality, the 22-year-old is well-known for his impressive musical abilities. Having only started producing in 2019, the Canadian talent has quickly wiggled his way to stardom. He's racked up a whopping 52K plays (and counting) on SoundCloud, catching the attention of <span>some of the biggest names in dance music...</span></p>
                        <p><span>Among the lengthy list of supporting artists is the legendary <strong>Don Diablo</strong>! Hard work certainly pays off; Dashi recently signed his first release</span><span> on the label head's <strong>Generation HEX</strong> imprint. Christened '<strong>Here For You</strong>', the boss himself previewed the single on his acclaimed <strong>Hexagon Radio</strong> (<strong>Episode 379)</strong>! The acid tech house heater is on the verge of becoming one of the hottest summer anthems. </span></p>
                        <p>In celebration of this monumental milestone, we caught up with the artist for an exclusive interview. We dug deep to discover the meaning behind the new release, his goals for the future, and more! We were sincerely left speechless by Dashi's genuine love for all things dance music, and kind-hearted nature. Be sure to give it a read below, Flag fam...</p>
                        <p><span>Lastly, the rising superstar's undeniable dedication to his profession, matched with his willingness to assist others to strive for their goals, is what we believe makes him stand out amongst the rest. We are expecting big things from this up-and-coming producer. Be sure to follow his official social media channels to stay up-to-date on all things Dashi!</span></p>
                        <p><strong>1) For those who are unfamiliar with your craft, can you share some of the highlights of your musical career thus far?</strong><br /><br /><em>I want to start off by saying thank you for your support on my music journey until now! That being said, I think the biggest highlight for me so far happened last summer at Ørigins Music Festival in Quebec. The reason why it stands out is because I DJed in front of an audience for the first time during the 'HAMRO and Friends' house set. Even though I only did two transitions, I will never forget the rush and love I felt at that moment in time. It was a pretty emotional experience for me, and I am forever grateful HAMRO gave me that opportunity.  </em></p>
                        <p><img src="https://scontent.fymy1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/241280072_233580188774000_5687881973013413310_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&amp;ccb=1-5&amp;_nc_sid=174925&amp;_nc_ohc=E77gcX-eNB4AX8-cx7g&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fymy1-2.fna&amp;oh=00_AT9uQWyfg8KPq8klYAC3icPaVHkiQ128RLinl-j4U24ZEA&amp;oe=62761121" alt="May be an image of one or more people and outdoors" width="310" height="310" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
                        <p><strong>Congrats on the recent release of your track 'Here For You' on Generation HEX. The aptly named single instantly got us dancing thanks to the groovy bassline all while pulling at our heartstrings. </strong><br /><br /><strong>2) Can you walk us through the various stages of the creation process, including the production elements and why you hold this track so close to your heart?</strong><br /><br /><em>Thank you! It's funny - I don't necessarily have an exact production process. When I'm producing a song, I usually start with the bassline/try to find a nice groove that gets my head bopping at home. After I've locked down that base, I can build on it by adding drums, percussions, and all of the other fun elements that make house music what it is known to be today! Then, I do more tweaks, and add final touches, until I eventually make a full song.</em></p>
                        <p><em>This particular track is super special to me because when I composed it, I was going through a rough patch in my life. I remember calling a friend to speak about what I was going through; plus, I wanted to tell them about the track I was working on. After I got off the phone, I came across the 'Here For You' vocal, and wrote the track with my loved ones in mind. [Some may call that fate!]</em></p>
                        <p><em>'Here For You' is ultimately about the special group of friends in my life. I am so incredibly grateful for each and every one of them. We support each other, no matter what the circumstances may be; this is something we'll share forever. There is no doubt in my mind about that! </em></p>
                        <p><em>Also, the encouragement I've received from the Ottawa Rave Community, especially at local events, means the world to me. I'd like to dedicate this meaningful release to everyone who has supported me up until this point. Whether that be my friends, family, or supporters, I appreciate you all so much!</em></p>

                        <p> </p>
                        <p><strong>Speaking of important aspects in your life; it's been made evident that you are a true supporter of our local dance music scene. </strong><br /><br /><strong>3) Why is it important to you to lend your encouragement to others, and what are some of your hopes for the future of the music community in Ottawa?</strong><br /><br /><em>Honestly, I'm a true believer in supporting others because of all the encouragement I've received in return. [Good karma!] I remember, about 2 years ago, thinking my dreams were unachievable. When I met dedicated and humble individuals within the Ottawa dance music scene, many of them really pushed me to strive for my goals. Without that support, I certainly wouldn't be pursuing my music career like I am now.</em></p>
                        <p><em>[In other words,] if I give someone advice, and they use it to strive for their own goals, I feel like I've done my job by giving back what was given to me on a certain level. I truly think Ottawa has some of the most talented individuals that I have ever met! I also believe we will see a lot of the local talent playing events like EDC Las Vegas and Lost Lands Music Festival one day - I truly do.</em></p>
                        <p><em>As for the future of the Ottawa Rave Community, I sincerely believe we are thriving; it makes me happy to see all the event companies within the city working together to help grow each other's brand. In my opinion, this fact is extremely special. With that kind of teamwork, Ottawa could be an even bigger hotspot/notable success in the EDM world.</em></p>
                        <p><em>[On that same topic,] I want to quickly give a huge shout out to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/audioform.ott/">Audioform</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fmgcollective/">FMG Collective</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/undercover.ott/">UNDERCOVER</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hypeakevents/">Hypeak Events</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pmprecords/">PMP Records</a>, for everything they do for the local music scene. They have all played a big part in my successes as well as where I currently stand as a musician. I am forever grateful! I can't wait to see what else these companies will do in the future.</em>.<em>.</em></p>

Which event are you most looking forward to, and why?</strong><br /><br /><em>There are currently two in the works that I can most definitely talk about! The first is the <a href="https://www.everafterfest.com/2022-tickets/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwyMiTBhDKARIsAAJ-9VucIXyyL1JBeJ4vU04kkm47F9ghLuURT2JGi9NgVdPiHDAb2SKZKlcaAv5REALw_wcB">Ever After Music Festival</a>! I'm going back 2 back with my big brother <a href="https://www.instagram.com/niceotope/">[Nic]eotope</a>! Tickets are still available and the lineup is absolutely cracked! So, you definitely don't want to miss this festival because some of the biggest names in EDM are playing. The second is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/originsfest/">Ørigins Music Festival</a> - I am super excited to play my first solo festival set. Talk about a full circle moment! </em></p>
                        <p><em>Also, there's an event in June, and another one in July, but I can't say too much about them yet. What I will say is that the lineups are ones you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">definitely</span> don't want to miss. You'll see some big features from our local scene. Lastly, I'm super excited to have the month of May off from performing to focus on building, what I hope to be, some of my best sets to date! Stay tuned...</em></p>

We are forever grateful that she's part of it! I also want to take the time to shout out all the homies from team Chapeau Vacances!

Speaking of which, I wouldn't be where I am today without Adam Comerford. He's the best manager a guy could ask for!</em></p>
                        <p><em>[Furthermore,] I want to give a huge S/O to Momma &amp; Poppa Dashi, my brother Jeff, and my sister-in-law Jose, for all their love and support.
