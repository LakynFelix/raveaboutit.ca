                        <p dir="auto">One of our greatest pleasures in life is seeing our friends succeed. If you've been following us for some time now, you know that <a href="https://www.castnowski.com/"><strong>CastNowski</strong></a> has been an artist we've supported from the very beginning. The Canadian house music producer has continuously proven that he's a force to be reckoned with, signing acclaimed record labels and performing on both the local and international scene. Truthfully, we couldn't be more proud of his rise to stardom!</p>
<p dir="auto">His musical journey has led him to share the stage with some of the biggest names in house music. If that weren't impressive enough, the Canadian talent also runs his very own imprint. In true CastNowski fashion, he recently took the time out of his busy schedule to sit down with us for an exclusive interview. To say this artist has remained humble despite his ongoing triumphs is an understatement. We discussed everything from his craft to life. Check it out...</p>
<h3 dir="auto">This interview's been a long time coming, and we're thrilled to have finally locked down a time to chat with you! So many blessings have happened to you since you've launched your musical venture, including some recent and exciting changes. That said, let's dive right in!</h3>
<div dir="auto">
<div dir="ltr">
<h3><strong>1) You recently wrapped up a killer headlining set at Escapade Music Festival. If you had to describe the way you felt on stage in 3 words only, what would they be?  </strong></h3>
<p><em>It would be four words: good to be back! It's been about 2 years since we've been able to have a full-on festival; as in, no restrictions. To see the crowd in front of me without [them sporting] any masks, no sections nor barriers in place, etc., was a really special moment.</em></p>
<p><em>Another reason why I enjoyed this comeback was because I was able to preview a few new songs in front of an audience. They ended up getting a great reaction which in turn made me really happy! I recently produced them; so, I haven't pitched them to any record labels yet. I hope to get them out there soon to eventually release them to my fans...</em></p>
<p><em>[On that same topic,] I'm actually in the midst of doing a fresh rebranding which showcases more melodic and vocal pieces, but, at the same time, I'm still trying to keep my underground sound. The rebrand is a lot of fun - I'm starting to include more horns and a Latino type of flair that I felt was missing before.</em></p>
<p><em>I pride myself on sticking to a "dad vibe" kind of style nowadays. I'm excited to share it with you all soon.</em></p>
<p><em><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0053/4862/2449/files/cast_480x480.png?v=1657118652" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="402" height="307" /></em></p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>2) In your opinion, what have been some of the best moments you've personally witnessed at Escapade this year, &amp; why do they stand out amongst the rest?</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto"><em>I'd have to say some of the best moments for me happened behind the scenes. Having the opportunity to reunite with some other people in the industry, that I haven't seen since the beginning of the pandemic, was great! I will never take these [occasions]<span> </span>for granted ever again.</em></p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>3)<span> </span>Congratulations are in order. You recently revived your very own acclaimed <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fraudulentrecords/"><em>Fraudulent Records</em></a> imprint! </strong><strong>Why do you believe now is the right time to give it new life, and what are your goals for the future of your label?</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto"><em>In my opinion, right now is a rebirth of the entire music industry - not just of my label. I've noticed a huge rollout of new artists, teams, venues...everything. I would say the revival is more of a "reorientation." The reason why I chose this word instead of the other is because I want everything about my craft to be more accessible. </em></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>I used to create more underground/bass-heavy productions. Now, I would prefer my sound to be more usable on the radio. I've already seen a shift in people reaching out to me on social media - it's proving that I'm on the right track of becoming more accessible to a wider audience. </em></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>[Furthermore,] seeing as how the music industry is going through this rebirth, I figured this was the perfect time to go on the journey together. Some may say that this period of time is emotional, in a sense, and I would agree with them. This is also why I've tried to shift my sound to be more melodic and vocal. </em></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>As for the future of my imprint, I want to keep it as a platform for myself and for up-and-coming artists that I personally think are amazing. I don't foresee it becoming a label that's exactly "by the books." I want to run my imprint by the way that I envision it, not by the way someone else pictures it to be. It's really important to me to be in control of my whole career.</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>[Moreover,] I have my business plan in place (spending, marketing, etc.) - I'm not just winging it. [That said,] I want to keep the label and my team close-knit. Over the years, I've met a lot of hardworking and passionate people. As time goes on, it becomes more and more important to me to surround myself with people that I can rely in. I'm really grateful to have met them.</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Lastly, this is a really exciting time for my label. Not only because of the people that I've brought on to assist me with it, but I also have a brand-new track dropping on July 8th [this Friday]! It's going to be called 'Anywhere You Go' - you may have already heard a preview if you follow me on Instagram.</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0053/4862/2449/files/208830943_234271641844472_1136145795282235266_n_480x480.jpg?v=1657122795" alt="" width="367" height="459" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>4) To accompany the launch, you released an incredible new single called 'Call My Name.' Can you walk us through the creation process &amp; why you believed this track would kick off the imprint on the right foot?</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto"><em>Fun fact: the first track was actually supposed to be 'Anywhere You Go,' but, unfortunately, it was a little bit more complicated to finalize. [Everything happens for a reason,] I'm happy 'Call My Name' ended up being the first track because I've always had this sort of attraction to piano house. I feel like this song is more fit for the summer because it hits home with that emotional side I have been leaning more towards lately. It all worked out for the better!</em></p>

<h3 dir="auto"><strong>5) Is there anything else you'd like to tell The Flag Gang?</strong></h3>
<p dir="auto"><em>I'm really looking forward to my show in Ottawa on July 16th! I hope you can all make it. It will be at The 27 Club and it will be hosted by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/edx.productions/">EDX Productions</a> [Secure your ticket <a href="https://www.edxproductions.ca/collections/all">here</a>]. For the Flag fam in Quebec, I'll be playing at the Unity Electro Fest (UEF) on August 13th and then at Ørigins Music Festival mid-August. </em></p>

<p dir="auto"><em>Aside from performing, I'm mostly just producing and spending time with my cat. I love him to death! I've been really focused on the rebirth of my label. Some people ask me why I chose the name Fraudulent Records<strong> </strong>- well, I wanted to find a word that wasn't overly used during that dark/underground era.</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>When I first launched it, it was when artists like Malaa started their careers. I was looking to match the criminal kind of vibe. That's when I came across the word "fraudulent" - it sounded sketchy in the best way! Now, I look at the word like a keepsake; it's holding me to my roots even though I've started to shift my sound.</em></p>
