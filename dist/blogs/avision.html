                        <p>The universe never ceases to amaze us! It's truly incredible how everything is connected in some shape or form. When we attended <strong><a href="https://theflaggang.com/blogs/news/event-recap-elevation-carl-cox?_pos=1&amp;_sid=febd41cb5&amp;_ss=r">ELEVATION 001: Carl Cox</a></strong>, fate united us with the event's opener, <strong>Avision</strong>.</p>
                        <p>It always brings us such joy to be in the presence of other individuals who share the same passion for dance music like we do. <strong>Anthony Cardinale</strong>, AKA Avision, is the perfect example of this as he fully encapsulates this fact.</p>
                        <p>In addition to setting the tone during this past event thanks to his expert musical abilities and track selections, he took the time to dance amongst his fans in the crowd. It was evident to us that he wanted to take in the full experience.</p>
                        <p>Unknowingly, we ended up right beside one another. Nearly immediately, we began discussing our ultimate common interest - the dynamic energy we felt while dancing in the audience.</p>
                        <p>It's an indescribable feeling soaking in the waves of positivity matched with music that speaks to likeminded souls. The full circle moment came forth now that we've connected with Avision for an <strong>exclusive interview</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Despite our short interaction in Montreal, we believe it was meant to happen so we could relay Cardinale's indisputable gifts to you all; such as his irrefutable dedication to his craft, his contagiously positive outlook on life, and more.</p>
                        <p>Although the cosmos may have played an important part in bringing us together, we also want to extend our thanks to Avision and his team. We appreciate the trust they gave us to share important life and career details with our Flag fam.</p>
                        <p>Without further ado; check out our exclusive interview with Avision below. We dove deep as we discussed everything from childhood memories, impactful career moments, upcoming life events, and much more!</p>
                        <p><strong>In your ‘</strong><em><strong>Avision: In My Mind Documentary</strong></em><strong>’, you reveal your dad had built a studio in which you shared amazing memories throughout your childhood. In addition to playing instruments together, he also introduced you to house music when he played the track ‘<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__ugaiz323k">We Got A Love Thang</a></em>’ by CeCe Peniston. </strong></p>
                        <p><strong>1) The way you described this recollection pointed towards an epiphany. Can you share some other moments in your musical career thus far that '[You] <em>Got A Love Thang</em>’ for? In other words, experiences that stand out amongst the rest due to their significant impact on your life as a musician.  </strong></p>
                        <p><em>Hey, thanks for having me! During my career, I’ve had many amazing experiences. However, there are definitely a few highlights that have inspired who I am today...</em></p>
                        <p><em>When I was just about to turn 18, I went to a nightclub in NYC for the first time. My cousin, Victor Calderone, was playing at a club called District 36. I specifically remember being snuck into the club, going up an elevator, and then straight to the DJ booth. I spotted a Gary Stewart 4-point stack system; which was unreal to see as a teen. It was 3 a.m. - the place was packed! I was completely amazed and inspired by the experience. From that moment, I knew I wanted to be a DJ/producer for the rest of my life. Moments like these have paved the path for me as they've taught me so much from a young age. </em></p>
                        <p><em>Another experience that really changed my life was attending the Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE)/traveling to Europe for the first time. Ever since then, I've always loved Amsterdam. At the time, I had released a lot of music, and these tracks were circulating between techno and house DJs. During the ADEs, my management and I went to so many events. I remember being shocked that at almost every party we attended, we would hear at least one of my records. That's when I knew I was onto something! That week, I was able to network, and build relationships, that have all played a major part in my career today.</em></p>
                        <p><em>This pandemic is a moment in my career that I will never forget. It inspired my entire album, and it made me dig so much deeper into my writing. At the start of it, I lost my dog of 14 years. At the time, I had a lot of emotions; between losing my pup, and going through the awful situation that the pandemic brought forth. I had so much to say, and I think the only way I was able to let it out was through my music. That's when In My Mind was born! This album was a pivotal change in my career. I feel like it put me in such a different headspace when it came to my writing, and made me evolve as a producer. As much as the pandemic was terrible, it was also a huge learning experience - a lot of good came out of it for me. I’m super blessed!</em></p>

                        <p><strong>On the topic of studio time, we have to congratulate you on your undeniable success following the release of your debut album </strong><em><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3s1mUrfpGAY2kFoBC08tFk">In My Mind</a></strong></em><strong> last year as well as the recent release of your </strong><em><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1qv2QeH9DOUCbGv8dwwlb1">Party Started EP</a></strong></em><strong> on Insomniac’s Factory 93 label!</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>2) You’ve previously shared how the legacy you want to leave behind is timeless music; meaning, it can be played from generation to generation. Although it’s evident you’ve proven this to be true within your notable discography, we’re curious ~ is there one track in particular that you would choose to best showcase your legacy, and why did you pick this one instead of the others?</strong> <br /> <br /> <em>All of the love and support towards my album and Party Started means so much! If I had to pick one record it would be 'In My Mind' as it’s the first vocal record I’ve ever done. I wrote and sang the lyrics; which is why I’m most prideful of that particular record. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a sucker for underground techno and house music; but I also felt like I had more to say, and this record showcased that I can do a mix of everything. </em></p>
                        <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bwz2TmMlAQI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br /> <br /> <strong>Speaking of your discography, you certainly have many opportunities to unleash your tracks to new audiences! Your tour schedule is impressive, to say the least, with many stops across the globe.</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>3) That being said, in addition to your most recent stop in India, you’ll also be touching down in the USA at EDC Las Vegas (May 22) and the Skyline Festival in Orlando (May 27). From a professional (&amp; perhaps personal) perspective, what are you most looking forward to during each of these stops?</strong><br />  <br /> <em>Professionally, and personally, I always look forward to playing for a packed show! This will be my second time playing EDC Las Vegas - I constantly attempt to do something special when I’m there. My goal is to consistently give the listener a ride in a short period of time. When I see my name displayed on a big stage, it's truly a dream come true - surreal even. I absolutely love having my hometown friends and family with me during these bigger shows as it allows us all to share the moment/memories together. It’s a real blessing.</em><br /> <br /> <strong>4) With so much excitement flowing through the air due to the “world reopening” following the pandemic, what are some of the things you’re most looking forward to in the near future?</strong><br />  <br /> <em>As much as the pandemic was a bummer, there were many great things that came out of it. One being my album, and all of the music I wrote during that time. I don’t think I’ll ever have that much time on my hands again that would allow me to create like I did during that time. Another project I took on during COVID is my collective Ground Rule, which is still in the beginning stages. [That said,] the pandemic gave me time to really go over what I wanted for my brand. It’s not just a music label, it will be about all platforms of art, music, clothing, paintings, food, and the true experience of the culture that thrives in New York.</em></p>
                        <p><em><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0053/4862/2449/files/avision_480x480.jpg?v=1649857574" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="330" height="330" /></em></p>
                        <p><em>One more positive that happened was my engagement to my now fiancé - we will be getting married in December 2022. I can’t wait to grow our lives together, and somewhere down the line, to start a family. For me, family is everything, and there’s no better way to share success and to be healthy overall. I have a long road ahead of me, and I’m just starting to scratch the surface on all fronts. Aside from my personal life, I am looking forward to playing all of my upcoming shows, and also hitting Europe this summer because those travels are always something I enjoy. [Lastly,] I also plan to release a lot more music - stay tuned...</em><br /> <br /> <strong>5) Is there anything else you’d like to share with The Flag Gang?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>I <span>always</span> love to share some tips for the next generation. I just want them to know how important it is to care about this craft. A lot of times, we get caught up in the social media world, and all of the BS that surrounds us in this industry. It’s important to stay true to yourself, and what you believe in! Build your sound, and look to be different from the next person. Don’t get all worked up about what’s going on. Trust the process, trust yourself, be patient, and enjoy the ride! I try to remind myself of this all the time: sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t; but, at the end of the day, I have a skill, and my plan is to always spread the love/do things the right way.</em></p>
